Chapter 1:
really like the descriptive nature of this chapter since it makes you feel like your in the setting. the character prabaker reminds me of my tl lol. im gonna try to imagine the characters in the book to be attractive characters like lin just to humanize it a bit more. especially since ive seen pictures of gregory david roberts.
