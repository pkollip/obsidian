had a couple very long meetings at work. one was fraud risk related and the other was planning for this coming quarter Q3. im super nervous on how to tell my team that I won't be staying for that much longer. really when you think about it I have like 1.5 months left which when your working a ft job, its pretty much nothing.

spoke a bit about aws certificate which is exciting since ive been wanting to get it for a really long time now.

dealing with a little bit of a dilemma with whether i should attend both bjj classes today or do one class today and the open mats tomorrow.
