My proposed project is to develop Affective Computing and AI for Mental Health Monitoring and Intervention in Secondary Schools. 

Given your research in [mention professor’s relevant research area, e.g., affective computing, AI-based mental health monitoring, computational neuroscience, etc.], I would love to explore the possibility to collaborate with your lab at [Institution Name]. Specifically, I am interested on your expertise in [mention professor’s specific research strengths relevant to your project]. 

I would appreciate the opportunity for a brief (20-30 minute) conversation at your convenience to discuss the following:

- Practical considerations for conducting this research at your institution.
- Possibilities for your mentorship or guidance during this project.

Importantly, please note that **the Fulbright Program fully covers all financial expenses associated with my research, including travel, living, and research-related costs**. There would be no financial obligations or sponsorship required from you or your institution.

If needed, I can also provide my resume in advance to our conversation. Please let me know your availability, and I will gladly accommodate. Thank you for your time, and I hope to collaborate and learn from you.
