## **Idea #5: Affective Computing and AI for Mental Health Monitoring and Intervention in Secondary Schools**

**Problem:**  
High-stress levels among secondary school students in India are associated with mental health issues like anxiety and depression. Early detection and interventions are rarely available.

**Technical Contribution:**

- Develop AI models using multimodal affective computing methods (facial/emotion recognition, NLP sentiment analysis, and behavioral analytics) to identify early warning signs of mental distress.
    
- Ensure ethical data handling, privacy, and interpretability for responsible use.
    

**Field Implementation:**

- Pilot AI systems in collaboration with secondary schools in urban settings (e.g., Delhi NCR or Bangalore); involve school counselors and psychologists to validate effectiveness.
    

**Collaborators:**

- IIT Delhi Computational Neuroscience Lab or NIMHANS Bangalore
    
- Collaborate with school counseling centers or NGOs focused on adolescent mental health (e.g., Sangath)
